# Project Summary

The main concept behind this application is to provide a method for users to KKKKK. The key features of this application include, allow the user to translate text to Morse code and vice versa, and follow a set series of lessons to learn Morse code. The progress of the aforementioned lessons can be tracked if the users makes an account (another key feature of the application).

The application allows the user to .... This greatly....

## Installation Notes
This version of the application will run on the same version of. There have been adjustments to the gradle file Build Tools 28.0.3 may be needed
Please note: The vibration and flash components do work and have been tested on several physical devices. However, the android studio emulator does not have anyway of outputting if the phone's light is on or if it is vibrating.

## Code Examples

**Problem 1: PAUL WITH THE DELAY THING ADD THE TAILCHAIN SOLUTION**

EXPLAIN THE HEAD TAIL SOLUTION.
```
// The method we implemented that solved our problem
public static VOID THING(VOID * THING?) {
    //YOUR CODE HERE
}

// Source: YOUR MIND
```

**Problem 2: Using custom made sounds with varying frequency**

Since outputting sound from a static MP3/WAV file limits user freedom the AudioTrack library to generate tones.
Despite the online documentation provided by android on this libraries usage using the library was tricky as it required generating an array of bytes that represent sound waves.
To solve this an online tutorial for creating an 8-bit music generating app was followed (link below).
The generateSound function (shown below) from the tutorial solved the problem with using AudioTrack.
```
private void generateSound(int frequency, int duration) {
    int sampleRate = 44100;
    soundData = new byte[sampleRate * duration];
    for (int i = 0; i < soundData.length; i++) {
        byte sample = (byte) ( Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * frequency * i / sampleRate) * 255 );
        soundData[i] = sample;
    }
}

**Problem 3: Efficiently Decoding Morse to Letters**
